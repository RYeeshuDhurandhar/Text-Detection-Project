# Text-Detection-Project
It is a python computer vision project. It detects texts on images, words, individual characters, and digits. It also shows detected texts and places bounding boxes around the texts.


Functions of each of the files are:
# Character Detection
It detects the characters, creates bounding boxes around them, and writes the detected characters below each character of the image.

# Word Detection
It detects each word, creates bounding boxes around them, and writes the detected words above each word of the image.

# Single Digit detection
It detects digits, creates bounding boxes around them, and writes the detected digits belove each digit of the image.

# Digit detection
It detects groups of digits, creates bounding boxes around them, and writes the detected digits belove each group of digits of the image.
